	Annote = {The personalist type is increasing. And the likelihood of becoming a personalist leader is positvely related with elected leaders instaed of leaders who entered to power with coup or insurgencies (In the cases of coup and insurgencies, leaders are confined to satisfy allies)

Authors suggest five indicators of personalization of autocracies
1. Install loyalists in key positions of power (courts, seurity apparatus, the military, the ruling political party and the bureaucracy)
2. Promote family
3. Create a new party/movement
4. use of direct rule/referendum
5. Create a new security services (to counteract with the military)


Authors suggest an interesting hypothesis

Coopting -> more likelihood of becoming personalist

Rational: coopting -> this enables autocrats to negotiate with factions as opposed to a united front -> easy to divde and capture potential threats -> more likely to become personalist


correlation is negative between lparty and likelihood of being a personalist

If cooptation reduce threat and not constrain dictator, we will see personalist leaders more

But if cooptation reduce threat and contrain dictator, we will see other types},

	Annote = {Short term effect of election (as an event)
- spurring dissent as an informatioinal focal point
--- electoral fraud
--- regime's inherent weakness (e.g. aw: known via regular election result)

Long-term stability effect of election (as an institution) 
--- help identify the opposition (for targeting cooptation or repression)
--- Send a signal that autocrat doesn't intend to fully monopolize power

(AW: Long-term effect is only after a regime overcoming the increased short-term risk of regiem failure. Then the long-term effect is conditional on this. Their hypothesis or tests do not account for this conditionality. The consequence of not addressing this conditionality makes us unable to explain what makes a regime to overcome the short-term risk. We also don't know if it is the case that a regime implements an election only when they are strong enough to overcome the short-term risk or if it is the case that long-term benefits can be harnessed in short term.)

Conceptual DV is longevity of the current ruling coalition (it is different than `changes in democracy masures' like Polity II)

Operationalized DV: regime failure from the data set by Geddes, Wright & Frantz 2014

IV: Executive election (from the National Elections across Democracy and Autocracy
- They used `'decary function' to model processes in which effects dissipate at varying rates (it's like having a different weight)


Addressing endogeneity 





Instrument identification p131

``While some variation in autocratic elections is probably due to strategic choices, not all is. To achieve identification, we aim to capture such nonstrategic variation with our instuments. The underlying notion is that variation in neighboring and other autocracies holding elections relates to the probability that a given autocracy will hold one.''

@article{przlimongi93,
	Annote = {"Political regimes can be characterized by two features: the locus of decision-making and the property right to the fiscal residuum, which is the difference between the total output and the cost of the government (Przeworski, 1990).  In some regimes the decision about the size of the government is made by citizens through some voting process; in other regimes, it is made by the state apparatus.  In turn, in some regimes the fiscal residuum is the property of citizens, in the sense that the state apparatus has no legal right to privately appropriate it (the state can only tax or accumulate stocks to use the resources as inputs to production); in other regimes the fiscal residuum can be consumed privately by members of the state apparatus."

"This framework allows us to distinguish three regimes: democracy, where citizens both ecide the size of government and have a right to the fiscal residuum; autocracy, where the state apparatus both decides the size of government and can appropriate the fiscal residuum; and bureaucracy, where the state appartus decides the size of government but citizens have a right to fiscal residuum.  Personalized dictatorships in the style of Somoza in Nicaragua or Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, as well as "crony dictatorships," such as Marcos's Philippines provide examples of autocracies.  The Soviet and eastern European regimes typify bureaucracies: the party or state decide how big the government should be, but individual members of the nomenklatura could not privately appropriate (sell, capitalize, cede, or bequeath) the output.  The same was true of the "bureaucratic-authoritarian" regimes in Latin America (O'Donnell 1973).  Hense autocracy and bureaucracy represent different forms of dictatorship."

Authors examine the consequences of these institutional characteristics. },
